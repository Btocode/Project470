# DocTracker
DocTracker is a webapp where you can find details of doctors around Bangladesh. The goal is to keep a centralized database and ease of navigation for finding doctors easily. It also incorporates some advanced filters for searching doctors.

**Current Features:**
Has a search bar and can search doctors by `name`, `hospital`,`bio`,`speciality`,`disease treatments`,`hospital location`,`appointment`.

**Bugs:**
This project is in its very early state and contains numerous issues that we are working on to fix. For starters, the webpage isn't responsive and may break on mobile devices/smaller screens. The search filters don't work properly as well as it is not supplied with any default fonts which can cause weird glitchings.

**Future Plans:**
We will be working on this project until we feel it's ready. Our plans / roadmap includes:

```
1. Additional filter for cross database searching
2. Improved and personalized search results by adding user account and Machine Learning search detection algorithm
3. Ability to favorite doctors and save them in user profiles
4. Ability for doctors to add / edit their profile along with appointment links
5. Ability for users to book appointment to hospitals that don't have options yet
6. Adding ability for doctors to host appointments/ online medical session via video conferencing
7. Adding direct payment method for user.
```
